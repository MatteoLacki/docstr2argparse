# Turn a docstring to a argparse arguments.

This reduces the boilerplate for automatically creating command line scripts with python.
Probably other projects like this exist, but this one is small.
Right now we only support google style of documentation.
This will be augmented with time, and extra dependency upon 'docstring_parser' droped.
I needed this fast.
